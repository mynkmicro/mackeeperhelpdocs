Make sure you are using the official website and not a third party page before entering any login details.

Accessing the Account from Different Devices
============================================

You can sign in from a desktop computer, laptop, or compatible mobile device. The process remains similar across platforms.

On a desktop or laptop, use an updated browser to avoid compatibility issues. On mobile devices, ensure that your operating system is updated for smooth access.

Using secure private networks adds an extra layer of protection when logging in.

Security is essential when managing software licenses and billing information.

Use a unique password that is not shared with other services. Avoid signing in from public computers. If you must use a shared device, log out after completing your session.

Enable available security features such as verification alerts. Monitoring account activity helps identify unusual behavior early.
